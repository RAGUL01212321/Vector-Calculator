This program was cereated so that complex vector calculations can be made easier. 
My program uses SQL which is set only to my computer. fell free to modify those sql commands to your computers needed.
I will try to get the input of those entites and make a command to get your sql details so that it can connect with your sql directly. I will do that in the near future
Some of the vector calculations that this program is capable of includes :

**ADDITION OF VECTOR :**
     Vector addition is the operation of adding two or more vectors together into a vector sum. My program is capable of adding only 2 vectors at a time 
     
Subtraction of Vectors :
     Vector subtraction is the operation of subtracting two or more vectors together into a vector sum.
     
**Dot Product :**
     Algebraically, the dot product is the sum of the products of the corresponding entries of the two sequences of numbers.
     Geometrically, it is the product of the Euclidean magnitudes of the two vectors and the cosine of the angle between them.
     These definitions are equivalent when using Cartesian coordinates.
     
**Cross Product :**
     Given two linearly independent vectors a and b, the cross product, a Ã— b (read "a cross b"), is a vector
     that is perpendicular to both a and b, and thus normal to the plane containing them.
     It has many applications in mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer programming.
     
**Box Product :**
     In geometry and algebra, the triple product is a product of three 3-dimensional vectors, usually Euclidean vectors.
     The name "triple product" is used for two different products, the scalar-valued scalar triple product and,
     less often, the vector-valued vector triple product.
     [a b c] = [a, b, c] = aÂ·(b Ã— c)

the calculated vectors magnitude along with the operation done will be stored in a table in Mysql.
